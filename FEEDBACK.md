## Features 

Congratulations! You met all the minimum requirements for Project One. 

All of the minimum features are fully functional and your game has all the required states we would expect for it to be played.

- Start State
- Win State
- Lose State

I know you planned to eventually implement more features/functionality so that every aspect of the game could be played to its entirety. So, I recommend taking the earliest opportunity to do so. ðŸ˜…  


## Code Style and Best Practices

Excellent work here, you have no commented-out or "dead code" in your files and you also use separate files inside of appropriate sub-folders for your `HTML` `CSS` and `js` code.

All of your `js` functions and variables clearly express their purpose in the form of a verb and a noun respectively. You also utilized camel casing with your identifiers and you have no console.logs in your code either. Your indentation well implemented. 


One thing I recommend you do to improve your JavaScript program would be to find ways to shorten the processes of each individual function. You can also delegate part of your functions to smaller helper functions, which would increase the scaleability and readability of your app.

## Documentation and Deployment

Great job getting your game successfully deployed to GitHub pages. You also did a fantastic job with your README. Thank you for adding a link to your deployed game as well.


## Other Conventions and Best Practices

You did a really good job with this game, Salma. As far as the code is concerned, you followed a ton of really good best practices we taught in the first couple of weeks in the program. As a final note, the biggest takeaway to improve upon would be the usage of smaller functions, which is typically preferred over fewer larger functions. 

All in all, you did an excellent job on your first project! If you have any questions regarding this feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know!
