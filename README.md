War is a card game typically played by two players. It uses a standard playing card deck. The deck is divided evenly among the players. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. 

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next 2 cards of their pile face down and 1 card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins all 6 cards and moves them to their stack. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

At the end of the game the player with the most cards win.
