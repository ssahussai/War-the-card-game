            <P>This is a simple two players card game intended for children. It uses a standard playing card deck. The deck is divided evenly among both players. Each player reveals the top card of their card to the other player, and the player with the higher card value takes both of the cards played and scores point. If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a tie and neither players score any point. The game repeats until all 52 cards have been played. At the end of the game the player with the most cards win.</P>
